It is so much easier to thrive in this program when you have a group of friends to study with, work on homework assignments together, and practice interviewing with.\", 'Focus on learning, NOT grades. Your success is determined by how much you learn and your ability to apply the skills you learn. There is enough stress in the program. Worrying about grades is not helpful.', \"The IAA staff and faculty are truly here to support you -- everyone genuinely wants you to succeed. Reach out if you are struggling, stressed, or want some guidance. April and Kate (professional services) are gems. Reach out to them with any concerns. The job search can be stressful (and emotional) -- comparing yourself to others won't serve you! Focus on being the best you can be, and MAKE the time to rest and recharge during the job search.\", \"Make the job search process your own and don't be afraid to be unorthodox, cast a wide net, and reach out to external companies. Tune out all the noise, and what other people are doing and what offers they are getting. Focus on yourself and your goals. Don't be afraid to start researching and applying early and do what is best for you.\", \"Use OneNote. Also, try to do some assignments (or at least a side project) in python. Many companies use python not R, so you'll be more prepared once you go into the workforce.\", 'This is probably all over TIPS, but the people in this program are some of the best youâ€™ll ever meet. I have made some of my best friends here, so much so that Iâ€™ll be living with some of them after graduation. This isnâ€™t your typical grad program where everyoneâ€™s cooped up all dayâ€” we all work hard, but know our limits and how to have fun! From our classâ€™ epic Halloween party to Tuesday trivia takeovers at Sammyâ€™s to our post-graduation class beach trip, weâ€™ve made some great memories and I know this upcoming class will too! ', \"Give yourself time to relax and have fun on the weekends! Try to get to know your classmates, everyone I've met is genuinely a good person, and many of them have diverse and interesting backgrounds!\", 'Time flies in this program, so make sure to get the best of it in terms of learning, practicing your soft skills, preparing for real-world and cultural differences in the work environment, and making friendships.', 'Have one non negotiable on your calendar that brings you pure happiness. For me, that was having friends over to watch The Bachelor every Monday from 8-10. Having something to look forward to each week was very impactful. ', \"Don't underestimate the power of networking.\", \"When you are a practicum or homework team lead, get in the habit of over-communicating. It's always better to promote and reach clarity about who is doing what, what needs to get done, etc., especially if you're in a remote setting.\", 'Lean on your support system outside of school if you can! This was super important to me personally as an underrepresented minority student - having my friends and family who know me and my values and goals to ground me throughout the process helped me gain perspective whenever I felt overwhelmed.', 'At some point you might get this big-brother feeling that the faculty are watching your every move. It is because they are. Use it to your advantage and show them that you are here to learn and make the most out of your time. They will reciprocate that effort. ', \"You don't need to do everything all the time. When the year gets really busy it feels like there's always more you could be doing whether that be reaching out to alumni, interview practice, or studying for a certification. Also when you look at your classmates you will probably always see someone who is doing more than you. But don't try to do everything or you will burn yourself out. I recommend setting attainable goals for the week and making sure you don't spread yourself too thin.\", 'Take advantage of the resources at the IAA! The coaching, counseling, faculty guidance, and technical resources you get at the IAA are tremendous, and you have them at your disposal. Use these resources to help develop your technical and soft skills and maintain your mental well-being. The IAA is a community that you remain a part of once you graduate, but you should take advantage of the resources provided while you are there. ', 'Make friends, trust the process, and enjoy the 10 months. The days can go by slow but the year is fast. Before you know it, you will be filling out a TIPS Google form for the next class!', 'People in this program are very like-minded. That means it is really easy to find people who think like you and like the things you like. Sports people, video gamers, foodies, outdoorsy types, the IAA has them all. Start a #social channel in Slack and start planning things!', 'Greet people as they walk past in the hallways or in class, even if you donâ€™t normally talk with them. ', \"Don't neglect balancing your speaking and writing skills. Oral presentations are typically more intimidating for most people and so are worked on more frequently, but be sure to keep your writing at the same level.\", 'Come interview season, prepare to talk about whatâ€™s on your resume at length and tailor your answers to show tour technical skill. More importantly, show your personality. Anyone interviewing through the institute knows the students are skilled. Companies are looking more so at who they could see fitting on their team. ', \"Don't get too stressed about this TIPS project. It just is setting the tone for presenting the analytical work going forward. It's not meant to be perfect!\", \"Create a personal system to keep track of deadlines for assignments, quizzes, etc. Whether that's using a calendar/calendar blocking, a task tracker, or something else, I found it very helpful to be able to look ahead to the next few weeks and understand how I was going to have to manage my time to get all of the work done. While a lot of the work is individual in the summer, this is complicated by the fact that so much of what you'll be working on in the fall is teamwork. Sometimes it was impossible to work ahead, but knowledge is power. Also pro tip - friends don't let friends forget their quizzes!\", 'It is totally normal to feel stressed and anxious throughout this program, especially at the start as you are adjusting to the pace and rigor. Just know that you will learn to adapt each time you overcome a new challenge and will come out a lot more confident on the other side.', \"Be confident during interview season. You won't get every job you apply for, but that's totally fine and completely normal. One of the most important parts of getting a job is fitting the vibe of the company, so make sure to be positive during your interviews. \", \"Don't be afraid to speak up during team discussions. You would be surprised by how much direction you can give your team just by sharing your thoughts!\", 'Remember to take some time to relax and destress. Your brain will need it. Get sleep, eat yummy food, exercise or go out for a walk. Hang out with your friends and family. Nothing is worth losing your physical or mental health over.', \"Although networking may seem like an extremely daunting task, if you start networking in the Fall it will pay dividends if you reconnect with those people come the job search. All you have to do is ask if people are available for a 30 minute chat to discuss their company, position, and background. Then reconnect in the Spring to ask how they've been, about their current projects, and if they are aware of any open positions. There is a vast alumni network and all alumni are more than happy to talk with current students. Networking is difficult, hard, and uncomfortable, but its an extremely important aspect of this profession that everyone is more than capable of doing. \", 'Take walks between classes when you can! Getting outside during long days was essential.', \"Don't be afraid to apply for your dream job! While it's good to make sure you have options, don't shy away from putting yourself out there and working hard for an opportunity that would make you really happy.\", \"If you're new to coding, I recommend taking time on the weekends to practice. I specifically took time to practice writing loops in Python and R, which served me well later in the program! And try not to compare yourself to others' coding skills. There are PLENTY of people who entered this program as coding novices and successfully completed it! You will become a much more confident coder due to practicing and not shying away from the coding aspects of data science.\", 'I cannot emphasize enough the importance of bonding with your teammates and classmates in general. Our year did a ton of Raleigh Beer Garden casual meet ups and things like this and I really recommend suggesting large group activities where everyone can chat and get to know one another. You are all in it together! It is going to be an amazing year, embrace the process and really give it your all and you will reap amazing benefits! ', \"Don't forget to take Dr. L's quizzes!\", 'Relax and \"trust the process.\" Good luck.', 'Go to Moge Tee on Hillsborough St with friends for bubble/boba tea.', \"Use the IAA's resources. Talk to your professors and ask them for help. Use the coaching sessions and mental health counseling. If you're struggling with interviews ask April and/or Kate for more practice!\", \"Good luck with your TIPS presentation! Don't overthink it :)\", \"DONT write off anyone and BE NICE to everyone. This is a tight network and you never know when that person you couldn't stand on your HW team is your only connection at your dream company. You don't want a burned bridge to stop you from reaching your goals.\", 'Get help from faculty immediately when you are stuck! Time is valuable in the program.', \"Counseling with Joe is a fantastic service provided by the program -- don't be afraid to take advantage of it for any little (or big) thing.\", \"It's okay to be a loner, if you are efficient and you value your time away from the institute, that's an okay thing to value. \", 'Start early with preparing for the job search process! Youâ€™ll do a mock interview with an alumni in December, but donâ€™t stop there until the process kicks up again in February. I suggest taking winter break as a break (donâ€™t burn yourself out), but come back strong in early January. I formed a study group with some people where we did four hour sessions around two times a week studying and interviewing each other. It really paid off because all of us got job offers pretty early on!', 'Job search is a stressful period, and just try your best to prepare for it, but remember that there is also a lot of luck to it. If you get rejections or are not invited for the first round of interviews, it can be for various reasons. The companies are looking for different things, sometimes, your goals do not match, but it does not mean that you are doing anything wrong. If that happens, talk to April and Kate, practice the interview with them, and review your resume and cover letter. They are there to help you. ', 'The days go slow, but the year goes fast', \"Try not to stress too much - you're gonna do great!\", \"If you are a parent, you might be feeling anxious about this uncertain journey you're about to embark on. Yes, it is possible to succeed in this program as a parent. Use the alumni network to get strategies and support. Set a goal to make it through Summer to December full steam. After December, your stress will change from managing a schedule  into finding a job but you will have more time to spend with your family. Don't worry, you will find a job. Just remember, you are juggling two full time jobs right now: a student and a parent. You're a super person.\", \"Try practicing your skills outside the classroom with a side project. I highly recommend a data challenge like the Carolina Data Challenge which happens in the fall because then you're done with the project in a week and you can work with other people. These extra projects will give you something extra that you can talk about in interviews. \", \"Develop a routine! You will be busy during your time at the IAA, and having a routine can help you develop some structure as you navigate that workload. It helps you avoid being overwhelmed and prevents that feeling of scrambling to get things done. \\n\\nEmbrace the 'suck.' The IAA will be challenging and stressful, but that is ok. The faculty know the program is a demanding experience, and there are times you might feel overwhelmed or feel tested by the experience. However, that is normal, and it is ok to embrace that experience. That is not to say you should bottle up all that stress and anxiety, but rather that you should accept those feelings are present and try and do something to address them. Talk to your coach, take advantage of counseling, talk with your peers, and lean on your support network. The program can be arduous, but embracing that can help you grow and learn more about yourself.\", 'The IAA is a family. This goes for your class but also for the alumni network. Reach out to any of us and we will be happy to talk!', \"Save your code! You'll be referencing it frequently throughout the program.\", \"Don't skimp on preparing for interviews. As a sometimes socially anxious person who struggles with speaking eloquently in high pressure situations, I think I would have been a lot more successful during interview season if I had taken the time to craft strong examples of how I excel with technical projects and refresh my memory of statistical concepts learned in the fall. While I knew I SHOULD prepare, the task felt overwhelming, and I more or less procrastinated until it was too late. While you can't possibly know everything, feeling prepared with a few great examples for both technical and behavioral questions will go a long way - be sure to practice saying them out loud!\", \"Sammy's Trivia on Tuesdays.\", \"This program will take as much time from you as you allow. While it is essential to maximize your experience at the IAA, remember that life doesn't stop while you are here and to truly be successful in the program, you can't let your personal life unravel. You may experience personal loss (death of loved ones, breakups) and struggle with the stress of the program (addiction, anxiety/panic attacks) - just know there are resources available to you to help you navigate. I found the coaching sessions and counseling sessions to be really helpful. I also was intentional in time-boxing assignments. If I was still struggling with a concept or troubleshooting code, I would schedule time with a TA (there are amazing TAs dedicated to helping you throughout each module!). At night, to help get my mind off everything and to fall asleep, I would try and read an engrossing book. Hopefully, these tips will help you! You can do it! And before you know it, you will be done!!!\", 'I am sad to see this amazing year come to an end. I never thought I could grow or learn as much as I have in the past 10 months, and to meet incredible people along the way is truly the cherry on top!', \"Work hard, don't forget to have fun, and cherish the close frienships\", 'For those who love nature, go kayaking with friends (bonus points for Sunset/Nighttime kayaking) with Frog Hollow Outdoors at Falls Lake in Durham. Also go hiking/walking with friends, there are TONS of parks and nature preserves in the triangle area.
